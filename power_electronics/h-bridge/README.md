# Description

Complete design documentation for a high-voltage power H-bridge.

The design is highly stable, capable of operating at frequencies up to **1 MHz**, and generates approximately **2 kV**. 

With a properly designed transformer (see [transformer](/power_electronics/transformer/)), this can reach **30-60 kV** in the discharge chamber.
